Algorithm 1. Get data1.1 Display the welcome message.1.2 Ask how many people are in the family.- If the number is less than 1 or greater than 6, show its invalid and prompt them again.1.3 Create arrays to store each person’s name and their teeth information.1.4 For each family member:- Ask for their name, there upper teeth string (convert letters to uppercase and if and if any letter isn’t I, B, or M, or if there are more than 8 teeth then re-prompt), and last ask for their lower teeth string and check those the same as uppers.2. Perform menu operations2.1 Show the menu: (P)rint, (E)xtract, (R)oot, e(X)it.2.2 Read the users choice2.3 Keep showing the menu until the user chooses X.- If P then Print all family records (names, uppers, lowers with tooth numbers).- If E then Extract one tooth:– Ask which family member.– Ask for layer (U or L).– Ask which tooth number.– Check all inputs and make sure the tooth exists.– Change that tooth to M.- If R – Find the family’s root canal indices.– Count all I, B, and M teeth.– Use the equation Ix? + Bx – M = 0 to calculate two roots.– Print both results to two decimal places.- If invalid, show “Invalid menu option, try again.”3. End program3.1 When X is entered print “Exiting the Floridian Tooth Records :-)”3.2 Stop the program.
